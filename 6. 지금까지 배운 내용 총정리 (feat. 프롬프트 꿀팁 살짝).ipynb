       "'Here is a classic recipe for croissants:\\n\\n1. **Dough:**\\n\\t1. 1 1/2 cups warm milk (105°F to 115°F)\\n\\t2. 1/4 cup granulated sugar\\n\\t3. 2 teaspoons active dry yeast\\n\\t4. 3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour\\n\\t5. 1 teaspoon salt\\n\\t6. 1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted\\n7. 1 egg, beaten (for egg wash)\\n\\n8. **Laminating the dough:**\\n\\t1. In a small bowl, combine warm milk and sugar. Sprinkle yeast over the top and let it sit for 5-10 minutes, until frothy.\\n\\t2. In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, salt, and melted butter. Mix until a shaggy dough forms.\\n\\t3. Add yeast mixture to the dough and mix until a smooth, elastic dough forms.\\n\\t4. Knead the dough for 10-12 minutes, until it becomes smooth and elastic.\\n\\t5. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm place for 1 hour, or until doubled in size.\\n\\n6. **Rolling out the dough:**\\n\\t1. Punch down the dough and roll it out into a large rectangle, about 1/4-inch thick.\\n7. **Filling and folding:**\\n\\t1. Spread the softened butter evenly over the center of the dough, leaving a 1-inch border on either side.\\n8. Fold the dough in half lengthwise, like a letter.\\n9. Rotate the dough 90 degrees, so that the folded edge is facing you.\\n10. Roll out the dough into a large rectangle again, about 1/4-inch thick.\\n\\n11. **Cutting and folding:**\\n\\t1. Cut the dough into long, thin triangles.\\n12. Cut each triangle in half, so that you have a total of 16-20 triangles.\\n13. Roll each triangle into a croissant shape, curling the ends towards each other.\\n14. Place the croissants on a parchment-lined baking sheet, leaving about 1 inch of space between each one.\\n\\n15. **Egg wash and baking:**\\n\\t1. Brush the tops of the croissants with beaten egg for a golden glaze.\\n16. Bake in a preheated oven at 400°F (200°C) for 20-25 minutes, or until golden brown.\\n\\n17. **Cooling:**\\n\\t1. Allow the croissants to cool on a wire rack for at least 30 minutes before serving.'"
